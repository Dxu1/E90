# E90
This Repository is dedicated to contain codes used for E90 Swarthmore Engineering Senior Project Design of David Xu. 
The project is Controller Design for Complex Path Following of the TurtleBot

# Guide to Code

1. graph: define nodes for Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. plan: Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. alg: Merge points to create a more concise list of waypoints that represents the same path
4. pf: output optimal path (from Dijkstra) given an input of image
5. controller_test3_1: summary code to control the movement of TurtleBot
6. transform2D: define necessary functions useful in finding the poses of TurtleBot from odometry data

note: transform2D is written by Professor Matt Zucker, which is shared to me by Professor Steve McGill when I took the class E28 Mobile Robotics in Swarthmore Engineering Department.

# Other
Path 1 and Path2 are two maps for two trials
